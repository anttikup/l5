## Task 3

There are different implementations of the stair case problem in the following link:
https://www.enjoyalgorithms.com/blog/climbing-stairs-problem

Compare the time and space complexity of the different approaches

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- Difference between divide and conquer and dynamic programming
    Dynamic programming problem can be solved by combination of optimal solutions to subproblems (optimal substructure)
    and overlapping subproblems. If the subproblems are not overlapping, it is divide and conquer instead.

- State some application of dynamic programming
  - Path finding algorithms
  - other optimization problems where the goal is to find the min or max with some transformations between states
  - longest common subsequence

- Difference between recursion vs dynamic programming
  Recursion is a general idea that can be used in dynamic programming, but also elsewhere.

- Difference between Top down and bottom up approaches to dynamic programming
  Bottom up solves the problem by first solving all the smallest problems and building up from there. Top down splits the problem into smaller and smaller parts and solves them. Top down is recursive, while bottom up is iterative. Top down is often easier to implement, but also has more time and space overhead.

- How to solve a Dynamic Programming Problem?
  1. Identify it is a dynamic programming problem ie. it has optimal substructure and overlapping substructures.
  2. Identify the state and transitions from one state to the other.
  3. Determine the relation between states.
  4. Add memorization
