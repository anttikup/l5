# Activities

## Task 1

- Refer to the following link. Discuss how the
  Recursive Factorial works:

- Refer to the following link. Discuss how the Recursive Fibonacci works:
  https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/DPFib.html

## Task 2

There are `n` stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. There is a simple implementations in `./src/` folder. Discuss how the code works.

## Task 3

- There are `n` stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs or **3 stairs** at a time. Write a program that counts the number of ways, the person can reach the top. You can use the following program as a starter `./src/staircase1.cpp`. Also the link below might useful:

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

-  What are the pros/cons of recursive over iterative Programming?
  Loops are more effective. A recursive function has to set up a lot of stack frames. The stack can also overflow the recursion is deep. Recursion is easier to understand especially if the algorithm uses indirect recursion.

- Difference between recursion and induction.
  Recursion is a method to get a value or executing code by calling a function inside itself. Induction is used to prove a something.
  Recursion and induction work to opposite directions. Recursion nth to base. Induction base to nth.
